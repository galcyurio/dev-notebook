`Data` can be __Descriptive__ (like "high" or "fast") or __Numerical__ (numbers).
And Numerical Data can be __Discrete__ or __Continuous__:
> Discrete data is counted,
> Continuous data is measured.

## Discrete Data
Discrete Data can only take `certain values`.

> Example: the number of students in a class
> We can't have half a student!

> Example: the results of rolling 2 dice
> Only has the values 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12

# Continuous Data
Continuous Data can take any value (within a range)

> Examples
> - A person's height: could be any value (within the range of human heights), not just certain fixed heights,
> - Time in a race: you could even measure it to fractions of a second,
> - A dog's weight,
> - The length of a leaf,
> - Lots more!
