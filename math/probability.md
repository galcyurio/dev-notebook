## Definition
probability of an event happening = number of ways it can happen / total number of outcomes

## Words
- `Experiment` or `Trial` : an action where the result is uncertain.
- `Sample Space` : all the possible outcomes of an experiment.
- `Sample Point` : just one of the possible outcomes. Sample Space is made up of Sample points.
- `Event` : a single result of an experiment.

## Types of Events
- `Independent` (each event is not affected by other events)
- `Dependent` (also called "Conditional", where an event is affected by other events)
- `Mutually Exclusive` (events can't happen at the same time)

### Independent Events
Events can be "Independent", meaning each event is `not affected` by any other events.  
ex) 동전 던지기와 같은 경우 첫번째 event가 두 번째 event 에 영향을 끼치지 않는다.

### Dependent Events
But some events can be "dependent" ... which means they can be affected by previous events.  
ex) 52장의 카드에서 2개의 카드를 뽑는 경우에 첫번째 event가 일어나면 51장이 남으므로 두번째 event에 영향을 끼친다.

### Mutually Exclusive Event
동시에 일어날 수 없는 event. 예를 들어 동전을 던졌을 때 앞면과 뒷면이 동시에 나올 수 없다.

### Compound Event
두 개 이상의 independent event를 포함하는 event.  
The event of obtaining the same side (both heads or both tails) when tossing a coin twice is such an example. The result from the first toss does not affect the second result. Both results need to be considered together to determine the final outcome.

### Collectively Exhaustive Event
