# Random Variables (확률 변수)
Random Variable is a set of `possible values` from a `random experiment`.  

- We have an `experiment` (such as tossing a coin)
- We give `values` to each event
- The `set of values` is a `Random Variable`


### Not Like an Algebra Variable
In Algebra a variable, like x, is an unknown value But a Random Variable is different.
__A Random Variable has a whole `set of values` and it could take on `any` of those values, randomly.__  

## Sample Space
A Random Variable's set of values is the `Sample Space`.


## Probability
We can show the probability of any value using this style:
> P(X = value) = probability of that value  

> Example (continued): Throw a die once  
> X = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}  
> In this case they are all equally likely, so the probability of any one is 1/6  
>  
> P(X = 1) = 1/6  
> P(X = 2) = 1/6  
> P(X = 3) = 1/6  
> P(X = 4) = 1/6  
> P(X = 5) = 1/6  
> P(X = 6) = 1/6  
> Note that the sum of the probabilities = 1, as it should be.  


## A Range of Values
We could also calculate the probability that a Random Variable takes on a range of values.

## Discrete and Continuous 
Random Variables can be either `Discrete` or `Continuous`.

## Summary
- A Random Variable is a set of possible values from a random experiment.
- The set of possible values is called the Sample Space.
- A Random Variable is given a capital letter, such as X or Z.
- Random Variables can be discrete or continuous.
